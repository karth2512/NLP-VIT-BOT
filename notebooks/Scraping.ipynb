      "[u\"Consider the following points and then decide for yourself.First, the good points:1. Good infrastructure2. Very good messes3. Decent student quality4. The management wants to improve the collegeNow, the bad:1. The place is very crowded: 25000 students in a 300 acre campus 200 acres of which are occupied by hostels2. Faculty quality is just satisfactory3. Their assessments are very bad. If you thought you have to cram only during school think again. You cannot clear the assessments if you cannot cram (mug up)4. Despite what the management may declare, students' freedom is limited. If you try to expose the bad points of VIT you will get in trouble and that is why I am posting this anonymously (I am currently studying in VIT). 5. The hostel rooms are very small and the charges too high6. VIT is FULLY FOR PROFIT. Everything is paid nothing is free.7. Many students come in through management quota (paid seats)8. Very high fees for the facilities provided9. The 100% placement is just an ad to attract students. There are people who did Btech and Mtech in VIT and are now lab assisstants in VIT. Also 90% of all the placements are in IT companies. If you want a core company you have to search for a job yourself. Also 60% of all the placements are internships\", u'Read this answer before you make a decision, this answer will change the way you think-PLEASE set this thing in your mind that VIT, Vellore and Chennai, are colleges just for profit. They want to suck each and every penny out of you. Now, there are other private engineering colleges in India as good (or I should say as bad) as VIT. There are only 3 colleges in India which are private and really \\u201cnon-for-profit\\u201d which are the 3 BITS namely Pilani,Goa,Hydrabad.I am a Btech. CSE student from VIT and now, I have started developing a hatred for this place.Ohhh, so good infrastructure, Ohhh, so well equipped labs, Ohhh so much greenery. When when you stay here a year or so with 30,000+ students inside the campus with 1500+ faculty, the place which seems so big now seems tiny. There is crowd everywhere, in hostels, in the campus, everywhere. Also the wifi is very slow. Jio speed is also very slow. I came home in Gurgaon during summer holidays and found that the Jio 4G speed was 10 times than what I was getting in the Hostel. I thought Jio was cheating on us but it wasn\\u2019t, I was due to some signal disturbance in the Hostel which stays there 24 Hours. Say bye to high speed internet in VIT for 4 years if your are joining. Internet is important for a CSE student because of the reason mentioned below..Quality of students is just below average. 50\\u201360% students come here via management quota and they get CSE. I got some 800 rank in VITEEE and VIT doesn\\u2019t tell the marks of the students in VITEEE. My class mates are those who don\\u2019t even know the spelling of computer are enrolled in the CSE program, copying all the assignments from me because I am the only one in their who actually practices CODING in CS. I became the class topper in no time thanks to the idiots. The atmosphere is anti-learning here.The professors are dumb-assholes. I know more than them. Yes its true. They might be having some shitty piece of paper certifying that they have a Mtech or Phd degree, but when I met and tried to ask doubts, the teachers tried to ignore me, did some acting. They just read slides in class and no explanation at all. I mostly study from books and online videos (I download IDEs and OSes which are of several GBs which is why I said having a good internet connection is a must). IITs also have bad professors, but its the students who help each-other there. I am telling you don\\u2019t come here think of just placements you\\u2019ll soon find that you have done one of the biggest mistake in life. Even my school CS teacher was having more knowledge than these so called \\u201cProfessors\\u201d, they are just actors and that\\u2019s why I neither respect these teachers, nor the marks they give, nor do I ask any doubts from them because if I did, I bet every-thing will go above their head. I got 100 in CS in my CBSE boards which I am very proud of, and I didn\\u2019t expected to land in front of these morons who think HTML is a programming language. When I corrected one of my teachers about this, he sent me out of the class. I am not going to take his name, but a clue: his name starts from S and ends with Y. I am regretting to say this that I even know more than all these professors combined. I wanted to learn CS from some experienced person, who can solve my doubts, help in my coding projects, but the condition of teaching here is CRITICAL.I couldn\\u2019t perform in some stupid JEE in the year 2016 and I still regret it. I took coaching, I had my concepts clear but, I panicked and under-performed. I was not aware of the pattern of BITSAT, so I also messed it up. VITEEE was way too easy that\\u2019s also a reason student quality here is bad. Now I will try to go in a reputed college like IIT after clearing GATE or I will go in US for Masters. I have no hope from VIT at all.You might be thinking by now that I have a personal agenda about this college right? Then you are right, I am having a personal agenda as this stupid place wasted the 4 beautiful years of my life. Also here, you will be imposed strict LAWS, which you should avoid breaking so that they don\\u2019t fine you. The worst thing is the gender discrimination. These LAWS get worse for girls. Taking with the opposite sex here is treated like a CRIMINAL OFFENCE , taking with the opposite gender in a healthy way should be encouraged so that we are ready to face the real world without being shy. I hardly talk with girls. I just have exchanged a few \\u201cHi\\u201d and \\u201cHello\\u201d(s) with girls in the last 2 years. I talked 1000 times more than this in my school. VIT imposes these strict LAWS on students to make a better image in the minds of companies. Also 75% attendance is compulsory. This might be considered good in schools, but in colleges, you have to do projects and coding which is much much much more important than sitting in classes seeing a \\u201cProfessor\\u201d try to say some words in English from the slides downloaded from the internet (I found the same presentation from the internet and I\\u2019ll post some pics later as a proof, they also edit the slides and write Made By-<Teacher Name>. So cheap).Now coming to an important part- Placements. Mostly SERVICE BASED COMPANIES like TCS hire the idiots in bulk from VIT, not just VIT, but other private colleges like SRM, Amity, etc. so the quality of employees is very 3rd class. VIT has a 100% placement record right? Technically yes. A CSE student gets a pkg. of 4\\u20135 lakhs per year. PRODUCT BASED COMPANIES like Facebook and Google and Apple and Microsoft don\\u2019t even come near these companies. Infosys ,Flipkart like companies have some pity on the smart guys- hard working students of these colleges and they handpick these students and give them good packages, what they deserve like 8\\u201310 lakhs. Also this 100% placement is just FAKE. Mostly the companies like TCS and Wipro are 3rd like substandard companies, trying to save money at all costs. They give you minimal work, give you some training about management and hire you as Clerk /Computer TECHNITIAN, yes you will not get any CS like programming work in these companies because they know students from VIT know nothing about VIT. Generally these students are kicked out of the company after a year or two. Except 5\\u201310 good students the other 990 students will be wasting their 4 years, 20 lakh rupees. The good ranking of VIT in top 10, is all FAKE, everything here is FAKE, JUST FOR SHOW. This looks like a product of China, Low price, Looks nice initially, but later you find that a thing from China will always be bad. Same is VIT. Please take a drop instead of heading towards VIT or any other Private College. You can easily study CS at home.Comparing VIT and BITS-Good quality of students in BITS, it has no management quota like VIT. Also BITS is less crowded.BITSAT vs VITEEE, you\\u2019ll see that students coming in BITS are really capable.No attendance, no reservation in BITS, no strict rules. This is one of the areas where BITS even takes over IITs.Professors in BITS- IDK, must be better than here from what I can say from other reviews.High speed internet in BITS, else JIO must work better there than here.This is why BITS is ranked in the league of IITs.Also VELLORE is a small place, you can\\u2019t visit many places with your friends. Overall your 4 best years of life are spoiled here.Drop, study hard and get in a decent GOVERNMENT COLLEGE if not IITs. Else try for BITS.', u'This was a Rant by 1 of my friends who almost sent this letter to the Dean. It may have a few spelling mistakes. Enjoy\\u2026Respect sir,I know that being the Dean academics is a stressful job. But that doesn\\'t become any less stressful by making the lives of the students miserable. I\\'m a third year mechanical engineering student and I feel like a guinea pig after a series of experiments that are being done on me in the name of improvement of the curriculum. The introduction of j component, the introduction of softskills etc etc are just examplesLet me give you an example. Picture this , a new student , first day of the college, enters the campus with the zeal to learn something new , is told on the very first day that the curriculum has been updated and that physics 1001 has a project component. So far so good. Now what puzzled that kid was the statement that the professor followed it by. The professor says \"Now students, for j component, you need to make something patent worthy. So that you can make money because it\\'s your idea and I can make money because I guided you. \"Now when I told this to my friends from other colleges, they found it hilarious. But for the guy who actually went through the ordeal it was anything but that.At this point I can\\'t help but feel that the top management is nothing but a bunch of money minting maniacs who milk the students for every last penny. Now this mail might seem like a hate mail but it\\'s an attempt to vent out the long and stressful frustration thats has been building up since day one in this \\'Esteemed\\' institution. I find it funny that the Moto of this university (ouch not a university any more) is \\'a place to learn and chance to grow\\', and everything but that is what is inside these beautifully constructed fascad.Let\\'s talk about something more relevant. In your lame attempt to improve the placement scene on the campus you guys have made coding mandatory for all the students. Now for the students who want to pursue other things like MBA or who want to pursue masters this is an absolute waste of time. More so what bothers me is the lack of thought in the implementation of the methods. Even if you wanted to teach coding to students, the curriculum is quite stupid(trust me I tried to comeup with a word better than that and miserably failed), and any one with half a brain dangling on his neck would agree to this statement. Moreover for students who could barely write a descent code, FORCING them to attempt a test on a professional coding platform seems quite unthought of. What would have been a better alternative was to allow the students to choose what they wanted to do in the future and modify the softskills courses so as to facilitate them to attempt the examinations that would help them achieve their dream. But then again that would require a lot of effort on your part and Im sure you have more pressing matters at hand than the well being of students. I can totally understand your predicament.And as unprecedented as the resemblance may seem the resemblance between a dictatorship and vit is quite uncanny. For example, there are guards posted everywhere in North Korea making lives of citizens miserable, so are the security guards and red tags in vit. Anywhere you see there are the poster and propaganda about the great ruler Kim Jong Un, we have our very own Chancellor\\'s pictures everywhere. And did I forget to mention the banners put up during the birthdays. I\\'ve always wondered where my fees was going apart from the monstrous fountain welcoming the unsuspecting parents and new students. Food is scarce in that country, in that respect atleast we have food(though tasteless) to keep our bellies full. The hostel authorities cram 6 students into a single room which is barely sufficient for 3 students. (Look at need rooms in F block MH )One thing that never ceases to amaze me is the fact that the Management takes no time to take credit for the students achievements. But at the same time makes the lives of students hell when they would want to use the fascilities in the campus. It\\'s just outright disgusting. And that\\'s me being very se', u\"The Answer is a 100% YES !If one can't get into the top NITS/BITS/IITS , It's the next best thing ( even more so with CSE) .The problem with all those people who are answering here is the limited mindset that the easier it is to get a college, The shittier it is. The industry doesn't care about your JEE rank, wake up people. Besides, I'd like to point out, that many of my classmates are JEE Advanced qualified , Most of my classmates are JEE Mains qualified (With respectable ranks) , so to the guy who said \\u201cMost people don't know anything\\u201d , Dude, stop blabbering random assumptions, and get your facts straight.Now, Here's a very sad fact, That we do have management quota , But, It is a lot lesser in number than claimed by people all over quora. I barely meet anyone who came in via management quota.Now, Before you judge us, Hear me out, An Engineering college needs funds , We have our fees for the meritorious students equal to that of most NIT'S , and way lower than BITS . Maybe, this is why it exists. But, the fact remains , we hard working students get access to a world class infrastructure , Paying a fortune lesser.Also, to the guy who said , Our professors are terrible, They're not, Many of my professors are IITans ( I personally know about 3 of them, they handle my core subjects) . Many of them NITans. Yes, we have out share of not-so-great professors, but again, which institute doesn't . Besides, you get to select your own professors , so that barely matters to anyone who is proactive enough.Coming to the so called 'tag' of not being in a NIT. I don't think, the industry people are dumb to hire VITians at such mind blowing packages ( 8 of them got the highest package of 39 L/pa) . Yes the average is around 5\\u20136 L/pa . But, the computer science average is A LOT better, I don't know the exact figures and I don't want to make any guesses here.Also, Some people out there comparing it with Amity,LPU . Ask yourself, if you get both the colleges, which one you'd pick. You'll know. This is an absolutely unfair comparision.\", u\"VIT is definitely better than Manipal and LPU. However, there are some things that you should consider.First, the good points:1. Good infrastructure2. Very good messes3. Decent student quality4. The management wants to improve the collegeNow, the bad:1. The place is very crowded: 25000 students in a 300 acre campus 200 acres of which are occupied by hostels2. Faculty quality is just satisfactory3. Their assessments are very bad. If you thought you have to cram only during school think again. You cannot clear the assessments if you cannot cram (mug up)4. Despite what the management may declare, students' freedom is limited. If you try to expose the bad points of VIT you will get in trouble and that is why I am posting this anonymously (I am currently studying in VIT). 5. The hostel rooms are very small and the charges too high6. VIT is FULLY FOR PROFIT. Everything is paid nothing is free.7. Many students come in through management quota (paid seats)8. Very high fees for the facilities provided9. The 100% placement is just an ad to attract students. There are people who did Btech and Mtech in VIT and are now lab assisstants in VIT. Also 90% of all the placements are in IT companies. If you want a core company you have to search for a job yourself. Also 60% of all the placements are internshipsAnd by the way some the answers say that only those who get 20000+ rank are not satisfied is stupid. My rank is within the top 10000. Only people who knew they wont be able to get any NITs or IITs and who did not expect to get a seat in VIT but somehow managed to are satisfied with VIT. Though VIT may be the last option for those who dont get NITs, IITs or BITS, VIT is not fit to be featured in the top 10 engineering colleges of India. The magazines were probably paid to show VIT in top 10.\", u\"I will reproduce this answer here again from this source , worth reading Anonymous' answer to Which is better: VIT, SRM, Manipal or SNU? Its an answer worth reading and pondering as a someone who is an aspiring student, a parent. In Short you can send your kid to Germany , Sweden, South Korea for a much lesser price. And in all cases a fully funded education programme, all that your kid needs to really do is keep hitting good GPA and save himself from paying any tuition fee. Please check out the public universities in South Korea too. e.g. KAIST, GIST, DGIST, UNIST-Ulsan. are some of the best in the world. But ofcourse German system is unbeatable.I recently answered this at another thread. It will take 10 minutes, which may be very useful for you folks. Hence I repeat:As a someone who has been in VIT for over 6 months before heading elsewhere for my MS. As a someone who had helped my friend in his startup in India, basically a job consultancy , I spent considerable time with these colleges under question. I felt sick after 1 year 6 months of the system and moved to East to pursue my PhD from a very reputed Public-National University. During my start up time I found that the HR's are paid a thick package by these private colleges from South. The moeny comes from your own pocket in the name of : Admission form fees, Admission fees, Counselling fees, Development fees, Sports fees, Special Fees etc.I have the following extremely strong recommendations to make.Compare the Heads of the institutions: VIT was founded and managed by a family. A family which started with Stone Quarry.\\xa0 The philosophy at VIT is henceforth profit. Create a facade and make profit. With Profit all the infrastructure you need can be built. All the HR's can be paid to get your students placed. With that reputation created by buying, you can attract European and American universities into signing the window dressing MoU's.So who pays for that money for all this glitterati? Answer: Parents! I cannot comment on SNU at the moment as I hardly know anything about it. Chancellor and founder of VIT, Vellore: G. Vishwanathan a parliamentarian, and member of DMK party. G. ViswanathanFounder of SNU: Shiv Nadar, the founder of HCL technologies. Basically a person who understood technical education from the industry perspective, IMHO. Again, this is just my opinion. I may be wrong about SNU but am spot on VIT. Not that the founders of VIT have done a crime. But,\\xa0 definitely thats not the way an educational institution should be.Ranking of VIT: There is a much ado about nothing, if you look at the ranking of VIT or any other institution in India, the ranking is ridiculously governed by the private media houses and not by an official AICTE or judicial body of the Govt of India. Tell me how can Lovely Professional University be better than NIT Warangal or Even NIT Bhopal? or IIT Guwahati? Do you seriously believe that donkey hoot?\\xa0 Tell me how can VIT have a better ranking than the Govt Engg Colleges? Placements is not a criteria at all. Please remember these rankings fall and rise as the cash flow rises or falls. In the same price which VIT, LPU charges, you can send your child to Germany and get a free education with a much better exposure and sometimes even better than any US university. Please search for the TU9 group of Germany, you will know what I am talking about.\\xa0Indeed South Korean Universities are very good or some of the Swedish universities as well.MoU of VIT with international universities: A perception about a group is governed by media. Media houses have showered so much praises that the consulates of other countries in Chennai received the same feedback which media provided. Everytime a university like VIT approaches these foreign institutions which donot have any other source other than their own mission posts in India, get a positive feedback fed by Media. As a result an MoU is signed.\\xa0 There is nothing wrong, but then its just a glitterati. Just deceiving, nothing wrong but then why this canvassing?Faculty of VIT: A frog in the well. Copy and paste lectures from the internet. Not that a lecture is going to change anything. But the faculty fails to even clarify the doubts arising during the learning phase in a regular academic session. On top of it, unrealistic evaluation process.\\xa0 I am really sorry, but glitterati is not going to work here.Who suffers?: Parents indeed, but the students suffer a lot.\\xa0 There is an unseen damage being done in the name of mere placements.\\xa0 There is an unseen damage being done in the way we are fed about the ranking of the institutions. What we forget is its the man who made the institution, an institution doesnt make a man.Hope that helps.\", u'OK. Let me me share my experience of last 4 years here. It\\'s my last day (or say few hours before I leave this amazing place..I joined VIT back in 2011, soon after when I was miserably failed in JEE and AIEEE, fortunately I secured a good rank in VIT.\\xa0 In past 4 years I have seen a tremendous progress in nearly every field in VIT and rules are one of them.Lets start from Infrastructure. Trust me there are very few places you will find in India or even in US univs. having such a world class\\xa0 infrastructure and when it comes to studies, which are pretty easy, you can easily manage to get good grade. Exams are not that tough, Only things that are taught in the class is asked so it\\'s easy to score marks..On coming to placements which I think most important, I don\\'t remember anyone who is still unplaced, every one has a job here or I would say the avg. salary is 4 - 4.5 lpa for non CS/IT guys and for CS/IT people it\\'s around 6 lpa. If you are joining CS/IT, grabbing a high paying job is just a piece of cake for you. Except foe few allmost every companies visit for recruitment. This year a lot of new companies, including Hedge fund, investment banking come for recruitment. As years progresses, the placement will go better and better. Next thing is Sex ratio which is really great. Getting a bf/gf is not that difficult just grow some guts.. In general you will have a group having lot of people from opposite sex. so don\\'t worry, VIT is not dry\\xa0 :).\\xa0\\xa0 You will find people from all part of the India, NRI\\'s, people from different countries, you can enjoy all sort of cultural, language and other stuffs. When it comes to higher studies, you can find our alumni in all most all topnotch universities, Stanford, MIT, UC -berkely, Hopkins, I, myself is going to join a well reputed US univ for my Masters. In academic research VIT always stands in top 5 across India, according to SCOPUS, leading several IITs and other academic institution. The labs are well equipped and each year they are starting new labs in collaboration with industrial companies. For example Microsoft, danfoss, honeywell, schneider, cisco etc etc has their labs here. The BIO dept. of VIT is outstanding in terms of research. the quality of research they are doing is paramount. A lot of people every year get foreign internships, MITACS, DAAD, SURGE etc even for final year projects, VIT has strong colloboration and MOU( memorandum of understanding) from a lot of foreign Univs. So, if you want to do your final sem abroad , you can easy go for it plus it also helps you for your MS too.. You can easily get admission in lot of univ without writing GRE and in some univ your applications will be given preferences from other univ if you r from VIT.Next comes the extra curricular. There are so many groups and clubs are there, providing unique opportunities and platform to grow and unleash your potential. On an average every day, there will be some group/chapter activity which will provide you new insights just than engineering. I learnt how to make a make a wireless robot in the first sem\\xa0 itself just from attending these clubs events. we have dance club, music, Make a Diff, .........the list is endless..When it comes to rules, they follows them strictly.Look there are more than 25k people are in the campus and its not easy to control them without following rules.. Back in 2011, the in time was 11:30 pm for everyday..Then, oen day few students were caught in malicious activities, and they shift it to 10:30 now it\\'s 9:30..They changed it as a precaution..and for people who are crying about PDA, Look thsi is not a place where you kiss your gf/bf openly... It looks awkward when other people pass through.. way back there was no restriction about kissing and all things in campus, when every one start kissing, hugging, smoothing\\xa0 openly they have to take actions. There are lots of people in VIT than just you, the faculties, parents who visits the campus, and other single people. NO one is stopping you to do anything outside the campus..Take proper permission, go out and do what you wanted to do ..who\\'s stopping. Rules are meant for your safety.. There is a set procedure of everything. If you want to go out of campus for 1/2 days you need to take permission from a proper medium this is only to ensure your safety. Every year, some one will do some nonsense and VIT has to enforce new rule.. Latest example, suspension of elections, it happened because 2 rival group start fighting among themselves. To prevent this happening in future, they just suspended the election and elect the representatives directly.. There is no harm in the rules, as long as you are following them effectively and there are not much of them..I am surprised people are making a hue and cry about them. Guys abandon your typical indian attitude of \"chalta hai \" and start act like a professional.. What you can do in your life when you can\\'t even follow few rules.\\xa0 lastly, for me its been a great pleasure to study here, I got to know people with different ethnicity,\\xa0 race, countries. Its really fun to taste all these mixtures at one single place. One thing I can vouch I have no regret in joining this place. I learnt a lot of things here, did great projects, won a national award, found a love, published my work in international venues,\\xa0\\xa0 got admitted to a to US univ and\\xa0 and a great placement offer as well :) Look in 4 years you are going to learn how to live and enjoy a life just don\\'t become a coach bag engineer, VIT offers a wide ranges of opportunities ranging from entrepreneurship, research, sports and all and all. Every year they are improving and improvising something. IT depends on you how to utilize these resources and get ahead in life otherwise there are people who will always want to point out the flaws from everything.JUST don\\'t listen to these mediocre people, who hate VIT because they can\\'t follow some rules. There is whole great life ahead it that you really will relish. You will definitely enjoy your stay here. Good luckI need to catch up my train in next 2 hour and there is still a lot of things to pack :)', u\"Lets start with the campusThe campus is a quite big one and is clean and green. The sidewalks are all covered and there are shuttle cabs available to take the students from one point to another in the campus with a fare of 10 irrespective of distance. There is a food court which serves variety of food and there is a papa johns pizza outlet inside the campus itself. The boys and girls hostel are on the 2 sides of the railway tracks and entry to the opposite gender in the hostel campus is banned. Coming to hostels\\xa0well I am a boy so I will only be able to tell you about the mens hostel. there are both ac and non ac rooms available with the various bed combinations of 1,2,4,6 bed rooms. the hostels are cleaned and well maintained and have 24 hrs water supply. The power situation is also good with the only problem being that in case of a power cut the AC and few of the plug points don't work. The hostel room allotment is on the CGPA basis. The 1st years have a totally isolated sort of hostel block allocated to them which are far from the other blocks. The rules have become strict compared to earlier times when the in time inside the campus was 9 :30 on weekdays and 10:30 on weekends for seniors.Coming to academics,Well like all the other colleges some of the faculties are really good while others are just useless. There is a system called FFCS( google it if you want to know about it) through which you select your faculties for each subject so the type of faculty you get is based on your luck and your internet. One great thing about VIT is the concept of grading being relative i.e. your grades depends on your class average marks as well. There are 2X50 marks exams called CATs which are converted to 15 marks each while you have 3X5 marks quizzes and 1X5 marks assignment and 100 marks term end exam which is converted to 50. This is the distribution for class based courses. For project based courses the internal marks distribution depends on your faculty while there is a 100 marks term end exam converted to 50. The labs are very good and have a great infrastructure and as far as I have herd are comparable to those of IITs ( this is what I have herd).Nowadays they have introduced a new stupid course called Advanced placement training which is really stupid and anyone planning to join VIT will have to undertake this course to get the degree. Placements are ok with the average salary of about 4-5 lakh per annum while the highest last year was 20 something lakhs which only 1 guy got. Most of the recruitments are through IT companies while there is a small amount of core companies like Flipkart , Johnson controls ,L &T\\xa0 Schneider electric which also recruit students.Regarding the location of the campus, its in Katpadi , just adjacent to Vellore and it being a small town don't have very high expectations. There are a lot of places just outside the campus where you get great food and you also have a lot of options depending on how much you want to spend. Then there is Dominos which delivers pizza till the campus main doors. There a re a lot of options also to stay just outside the campus. The main Vellore city also has a lot of places to eat and stay near the CMC area . You can take an auto or a bus to Vellore. It also has a lot of shops which sell electronic goods which might be required by you for your projects. Then you have Chennai at a distance of about 150km while Bangalore is at a distance of 250 km. you will get the flight at these places to go to your home while there is a huge number of trains from the Katpadi Junction which is around 10-15 min in a auto from the campus.I think this much info should be enough for anyone wanting to know about VIT,Vellore.\", u\"Being a VITian myself I would like to give my inside view on this question. I don't consider all the college rankings and stuff but just living here for 2 years I'm quiet sure that VIT Vellore is one of the finest college across the country. There are always 2 sides to a coin.Pros -Infrastructure - Huge college buildings, hostel blocks, cafeterias, health center, outdoor stadium makes it one of the best planned university. Especially the labs are updated with latest technologies.Campus life - There always some fun events going on in the campus everyday and it doesn't feel dull at all. It's a fun place to hangout.Exposure - For a small town kid like me, I would've never got an opportunity to live among people from all over the country. VIT has a diverse population from across the country and hence we get to know different cultures and traditions.Student clubs & chapters - When I talk about exposure, the various clubs & chapters play a big role. A collection of finest & most diverse clubs give the students every opportunity to grow as a person.Fests - graVITas (Technical fest) & Riviera (Cultural fest) are two of the biggest fests across the country. Biggest known celebs and comedians perform every year.Cons -Illogical rules - A boy and a girl cannot have any other physical contact other than handshake otherwise the Red Tag Annas (Special moral policing force) will catch you and charge a fine. (Don't worry love birds do find quiet a few places in such a huge campus :P)Gender bias - Girls have an earlier hostel in-time, a strict procedure for applying for leaves, limited number of outings in a month.Rickshawwalas - This is more of a Pro tip than a con. Do make Tamil friends because the rickshaw walas only listen to them. They will also charge huge amounts illogically. Being a hosteller, we're not allowed to have our vehicles.All in all, there are always positives & negatives. In my view point, VIT Vellore is the best thing which could've happened to me. It has changed me as a person. Surely, a college to learn, grow & enjoy.\"]\n"

People still seem confused on the whole process. Please go through this answer *FULLY* before jumping to any conclusion s.Firstly to those who are asking for a cutoff , THERE IS NOTHING CALLED CUTOFF IN VIT. Rather than cutoff, it's the money that you wanna shell out\\u2026based on your rank\\u2026 Let's check out the fees here for different categories. All are only tuition fees\\u2026Category 1:- Rs 1.97 LPACategory 2:- Rs 3.07 LPACategory 3:- Rs 4.07 LPACategory 4:- Rs 4.43 LPACategory 5:- Rs 4.97 LPANote:- This is for the year 2018. Might increase in the future\\u2026.Next the seats are filled based on these categories starting from category 1 for different branches\\u2026Now based on current and previous trends, it hasbeen noticed that preferred courses are in this order.CSE> IT>ECE> ECM>EEE\\u2026and then biotech, mechanical, civil, in the end etc. etc.And the preference of colleges are Vellore> Chennai> Bhopal > APNow based on the ranks, let me give u a brief idea.If your rank is under 7k , then u will get ANY BRANCH IN ANY COLLEGE in the first category itself, so no need to worry at all :)If your rank is under 12k , then u might not get cse in Vellore, in the first category. But u will get the same in other town\\u2026.And so on it goes\\u2026Now for the 1st category let me give u the probable ranks under which you will get.( Only for Vellore)Cse:- 7kIT:- 12kECE:- 18kEEE:- 23k..Civil, mechanical, biotech around 50k \\u2026For Chennai.CSE:- 10kECE:- 25kEEE:-35kMechanical:- 60kAnd so on\\u2026For the remaining categories 2, 3 and 4 just add around 10k ranks and u'll get the required number.
